## Programming Language
`go version go1.9 darwin/amd64`

## Instructions

1. Install `go1.9` ([installation instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install))
2. Build the program with the following command: `go build -i -o pipeline pipeline.go`
3. Run the program with the following command: `./pipeline <input_file> <stop_words_file>`


## Observations

Some of the built-in Python features used in the sample programs are not available in go and where implemented at the beginning of the program.

Variables and function names where kept similar to the ones in the sample program while following go's naming standards such as camelCase.
